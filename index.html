    <p id="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks?</p>
    <p id="web-security-answer">[Web security threats can have severe consequences for website owners, and front-end developers must take steps to protect users from potential harm. Best practices such as data sanitization, secure authorization and authentication, using well-known third-party applications, continuous deployment/continuous integration, and implementing automatic user timeout can all help to improve web security. Network security is also essential for protecting the exchange of data packets, and website owners should use secure hosting platforms, HTTPS protocols, and keep SSL/TLS certificates up-to-date. Keeping software up-to-date with the latest security patches, validating and sanitizing user input, and implementing strong authentication and authorization practices can prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data. Finally, website owners should educate their staff on good security practices, including password hygiene, phishing prevention, and reporting security incidents. By following these best practices and being aware of potential risks, website owners can significantly improve the security of their website and protect their users from potential harm.]</p>
